    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Chicken Stir-Fry is a quick and flavorful dish that brings together the essence of Asian cuisine with
        minimal effort. Start by heating sesame oil in a wok or large pan, where you'll first sauté minced garlic and
        grated ginger for a burst of aromatic flavors. Next, introduce thinly sliced chicken breast, cooking until it's
        nearly done but still tender. Then, add a colorful medley of vegetables like broccoli, bell peppers, and snap
        peas, stir-frying them until they achieve a delightful crisp-tender texture. A splash of soy sauce unifies the
        ingredients, providing that iconic umami taste. Serve this vibrant dish hot, perhaps over a bed of steamed rice,
        for a complete, satisfying meal.</p>
