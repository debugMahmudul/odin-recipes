    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Caprese Salad is simplicity at its finest,
        marrying the freshness of summer in a dish that's as beautiful to look at as it is to eat. Begin with slices of
        ripe, juicy tomatoes and creamy, fresh mozzarella, layered alternately on a plate. Intersperse each layer with
        vibrant green basil leaves for a touch of herbaceousness. A drizzle of high-quality olive oil and a balsamic
        glaze (or just vinegar) not only adds depth but also visually enhances the dish. A light seasoning of salt and
        pepper brings out the natural flavors of each component. This salad should be served immediately to enjoy the
        peak freshness of its ingredients, making it an ideal appetizer or side for any meal.</p>
