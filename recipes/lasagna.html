    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This homemade lasagna recipe is comforting and straightforward.
        Start by boiling lasagna noodles until they're just tender.
        In another pan, brown your choice of ground beef or Italian sausage, then mix in a rich marinara sauce.
        For the cheese layer, blend ricotta with an egg and some herbs like basil and oregano for flavor.
        Layer everything in a baking dish: noodles, meat sauce, the ricotta mixture, and then shredded mozzarella.
        Repeat until you've used all your ingredients,
        topping off with mozzarella and a dusting of Parmesan for that perfect golden crust.</p>

    <p>Bake your assembled lasagna covered to keep it moist, then uncover towards the end to brown the cheese.
        The oven should be set at 375째F (190째C), and the total baking time is about 50 minutes.
        This dish combines the heartiness of meat with the creaminess of cheese, all encased in layers of soft noodles,
        making it a beloved classic for family dinners or special occasions.</p>
